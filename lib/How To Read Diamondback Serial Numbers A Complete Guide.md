In this article, we will show you how to read Diamondback serial numbers and what they mean. We will also provide some tips on how to find the serial number on your bike and how to use it to check the history and value of your bike.
 
## Where To Find The Serial Number On Your Diamondback Bike
 
The serial number on your Diamondback bike is usually located on the underside of the bottom bracket shell, which is the part of the frame that connects the crankset to the bike. To find it, you will need to flip your bike over and look for a series of numbers and letters stamped or engraved on the metal.
 
Some older models may have the serial number on other parts of the frame, such as the head tube, seat tube, or rear dropout. If you have trouble finding the serial number on your bike, you can refer to this [serial number locator](https://www.diamondback.com/support/serial-number-locator) from Diamondback's official website.

## How To Read Diamondback Serial Numbers
 
Diamondback serial numbers are composed of two parts: a prefix and a suffix. The prefix is usually one or two letters that indicate the factory code or the model code. The suffix is usually six or seven digits that indicate the production date and the sequence number.
 
For example, let's take a look at this serial number: F80402987. The prefix is F8, which means that this bike was made in Taiwan by Fairly Bike Manufacturing Co., Ltd., one of Diamondback's suppliers. The suffix is 0402987, which means that this bike was made on April 2nd, 1998, and it was the 987th bike produced that day.
 
Here are some common prefixes and their meanings:
 
- A = China
- C = China
- D = Taiwan (Darfon)
- F = Taiwan (Fairly)
- G = Taiwan (Giant)
- H = Taiwan (Hodaka)
- K = Taiwan (Kinesis)
- L = Taiwan (Lung Jye)
- M = Taiwan (Merida)
- N = China (Nanjing)
- P = Taiwan (Pacific Cycle)
- R = Taiwan (Rampar)
- S = Taiwan (Shun Feng)
- T = Taiwan (Tien Hsin)
- U = China (Univega)
- V = China (Velo Enterprise)
- W = China (Winstar)
- X = China (XDS)
- Y = China (Yong Jie)
- Z = China (Zhejiang Yongkang Huabao Electric Appliance Co., Ltd.)

Some prefixes may also indicate the model code, such as DBR for Diamondback Racing or DBX for Diamondback X-Series. However, these prefixes are not consistent across all models and years.
