The game features two playable protagonists: Jacob and Evie Frye, who are twins and members of the Assassin Brotherhood. Jacob is a hot-headed and charismatic leader of a gang called the Rooks, who seeks to liberate London from the Templars' control. Evie is a calm and intelligent master of stealth, who pursues the Pieces of Eden, ancient artifacts that grant supernatural powers. The player can switch between the two characters at any time during the game, except for some story missions that are specific to one of them. The game also allows the player to customize the appearance and skills of both characters.
 
The game's open world is divided into seven districts: Whitechapel, City of London, Lambeth, Southwark, Westminster, The Strand, and The Thames. Each district has its own landmarks, activities, collectibles, and enemies. The player can use various modes of transportation to traverse the city, such as carriages, trains, boats, and a rope launcher that allows the player to zip-line across buildings. The game also features a day-night cycle and dynamic weather system that affect the gameplay and visuals.
